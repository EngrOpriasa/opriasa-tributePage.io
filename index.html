                <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1998:</strong> Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
                    <li><strong>1999:</strong>  Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP),[4] and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
                    <li><strong>2001:</strong>  Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:[5]
                        The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;
                        The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;
                        The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>2001:</strong> The XP team at Connextra[6] in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>2004:</strong> Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development[7] that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler.[8] Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories.[citation needed] While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.
                    </li>
                    <li> <strong>2014:</strong> After a first article in 2005[9] and a blog post in 2008,[10] in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    <p> "Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching
                        contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and
                        scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."
                    </p>
